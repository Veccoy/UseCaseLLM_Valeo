Moreover, several datasets are available on HuggingFace. I will be using the [XSum](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08745) dataset available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EdinburghNLP/xsum), which contains BBC articles accompanied with single-sentence summaries.\n","\n","Now, let's talk about the chosen model. The T5 model is an encoder-decoder model pre-trained on a multi-task mixture of unsupervised and supervised tasks. T5 works well on a variety of tasks out-of-the-box by prepending a different prefix to the input corresponding to each task, e.g., for translation or summarization. In my case, the prefix for summarization task will be `summarize: `. It uses relative scalar embeddings and comes in different sizes: small, base, large, 3b, 11b.\n","\n","To fine-tune the model, I use LoRA, or Low Rank Adaptation, from the PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning) family. It is a technique that accelerates the fine-tuning of large models while consuming less memory, which is something valuable in my Google Colab environment! The idea is to freeze the original pre-trained weights and introduce an additional matrix computed using matrix decomposition, which makes it small. This new matrix is trained on new data while the original weights matrix are frozen, thus reducing the number of trainable parameters. Finally, both the original and the new weights are combined.\n","\n","To evaluate the fine-tuned model and compare it with the original one, I chose the ROUGE metric. [ROUGE](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/rouge), or Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, is used for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation software in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In my case, it will compare an automatically produced summary with a human-produced (set of) reference(s). ROUGE is case insensitive and consists of 4 different metrics (depending on the length of the subsequence you base your score)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"r0s0K6bc9F2M"},"source":["## Requirements and
