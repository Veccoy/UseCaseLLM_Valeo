Moreover, several datasets are available on HuggingFace. I will be using the [XSum](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08745) dataset available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EdinburghNLP/xsum), which contains BBC articles accompanied with single-sentence summaries.\n","\n","Now, let's talk about the chosen model. The T5 model was presented in [Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf) by Colin Raffelet al. and is an encoder-decoder model pre-trained on a multi-task mixture of unsupervised and supervised tasks and for which each task is converted into a text-to-text format. T5 works well on a variety of tasks out-of-the-box by prepending a different prefix to the input corresponding to each task, e.g., for translation or summarization. In our case, the prefix for summarization task will be `summarize: `. It uses relative scalar embeddings and comes in different sizes: small, base, large, 3b, 11b.\n","\n","I chose the T5-small model for three reasons:\n","\n","*   T5 models are very well suited for summarization tasks ;\n","*   I am familiar with this family of model ;\n","*   From a practical point of view, I fine-tuned the model using a T4 GPU from Google Colab and the T5-small is the smallest model possible.\n","\n","To fine-tune the model, I use LoRA, or Low Rank Adaptation, from the PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning) family. It is a technique that accelerates the fine-tuning of large models while consuming less memory, which is something valuable in my Google Colab environment! The idea is to freeze the original pre-trained weights and introduce an additional matrix computed using matrix decomposition, which makes it small. This new matrix is trained on new data while the original weights matrix are frozen, thus reducing the number of trainable parameters. Finally, both the original and the adapted weights are combined.\n","\n","To evaluate the fine-tuned model and compare it with the original one, I chose the ROUGE metric. [ROUGE](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/rouge), or Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, is used for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation software in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In our case, it will compare an automatically produced summary with a human-produced (set of) reference(s). ROUGE is case insensitive and consists of 4 different metrics (depending on the length of the subsequence you base your score)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"r0s0K6bc9F2M"},"source":["## Requirements and
